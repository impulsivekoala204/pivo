                Here, I decided to turn to UI design instead of UX more broadly. I attempted to redesign the application interface for Pivo Technologies. A fintech interface for truckers in Africa. I used minimal design and a vivid color scheme for the look. I first started with a low fideity wireframe which was ultimately translated to the prototype linked below.

                This was the final prototype containing the login, home, payments, transactions, profile and settings screens. The prototype can be interacted with by clicking on the active areas.
